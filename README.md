# VolleyballSim
Volleyball simulator python code. Runs entirely in terminal.
If trying to run, use on of the inbuilt teams (i.e. attached text files).
The simulator has a deliberate delay in it of 0.8 seconds between most outputs, its not lagging.
If you would like to design your own team, read TeamStructure.txt.
